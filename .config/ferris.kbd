An experiment for using kanata to prepare for 34-key Ferris Sweep keyboard.

Essentially, it allows only 34 keys to be pressed in similar layout as target Ferris Sweep.

When I buy Ferris Sweep, transition should be much more smooth after practicing with this layout.

This layout will be supposedly translated to Ferris Sweep firmware.
